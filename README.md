#Meetigs:

We have had two meetings in which we discussed which tool we should use for testing our project (StoreFront). 
Then we decided to go with cocumber and selenium.

Then after that we have had a meeting with sir Jawad about the tools, we have chosen to test our project.

Finally, we had a meeting in which we distributed the tasks among us and after that we started working on it.
