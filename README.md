#Tasks:

I have made branches on github. Moreover, I have done UI test automation. Also, I have done API test automation.

I conducted meetings with my partners as an individual and took notes. Additionally, I created specific tasks just for me in my github repository. It made duties as brief as feasible while properly maintaining their status. Additionally, I used Cucumber and Selenium to automate my three Gherkin test cases. I also used Jet and Frisby Concept to automate my API tests. I also reviewed my partners' code for errors. Finally, I investigated the UI and automation framework of React-Store Front and recorded my findings in a text file.
